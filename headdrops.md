# Player Heads
!>This section covers *custom heads* and **player and mob head drops**. This section does not cover [Dead Chests]() which also come in the form of player heads, which can not be obtained.
## Player and Mob head drops
Our server features a possible drop chance each time a mob or player is slain. These heads can be **worn on players**, **displayed on armour stands** or **placed just like normal blocks**. [Drop rates](#Mob-head-drop-rates) are fairly rare, which makes mob heads almost like trophies! Many players have already started display stands for all the heads they have collected.

### Mob head drop rates
> These rates are susceptible to change, A value of 1 is equal to a 100% drop rate. For example, a value of 0.025 would be equal to a 2.5%.
