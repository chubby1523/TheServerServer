# Joining the Server
Players will require an unmodded install of Minecraft `1.18.1` to join. This includes both [Java edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition) and [Bedrock edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) of the game.

> The term **Bedrock edition** covers the **Windows 10/11, Pocket and Console editions** of the game.
## Discord Server integration
New players must link their **Discord account** to their **Minecraft account** in order to play, this can be done by:
1. Joining the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DN6SHSQPqA)
2. After attempting to connect to the Minecraft Server by following [this guide](#Connecting-to-the-Minecraft-Server), a message will appear

```Message that will appear after being kicked from Server
